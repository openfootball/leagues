q:  what is the naming history of the Argentine top / tier 1 football league. 
please use seasons for name changes.

a: The naming history of **Argentina's top-tier football league** has evolved over the years, driven by changes in its structure, political influences, and sponsorships. Below is the detailed breakdown of the naming history based on the seasons:

### 1. **1891–1934: Argentine Championship (Campeonato Argentino)**
   - The Argentine top-tier league was originally known as the **Campeonato Argentino** (Argentine Championship) when it was first established in **1891**. The competition started as an amateur tournament, and teams from the capital, Buenos Aires, and surrounding areas participated.
   - During this early period, there were no official league structures, and the championship was played in a relatively informal format.

### 2. **1931–1967: Primera División (First Division)**
   - In **1931**, professional football was introduced in Argentina, and the league became formally structured as the **Primera División** (First Division). This marked the beginning of the professional era in Argentine football.
   - The **Primera División** name continued for several decades and was the dominant name for the country's top football competition. The league operated under this title during Argentina’s golden age in football, with legendary clubs and players emerging.
   - The league retained the name **Primera División** even as it experienced various changes in format and number of participating teams.

### 3. **1967–1985: Metropolitano and Nacional**
   - In **1967**, the league was divided into two parallel tournaments: the **Metropolitano** (Metropolitan) and the **Nacional** (National). This division was implemented due to the growth of football across Argentina and logistical reasons.
   - The **Metropolitano** involved teams from Buenos Aires, while the **Nacional** featured clubs from other regions of Argentina.
   - This system persisted until **1985**, with the **Metropolitano** and **Nacional** tournaments running separately in different seasons.

### 4. **1985–1991: Primera División (reverted)**
   - In **1985**, the league structure was reformed again, and the **Primera División** (First Division) name was reinstated. The competition returned to a single-league format, where all teams played in one competition.
   - The name **Primera División** continued until the early 1990s, though there were still fluctuations in the number of teams and changes in how the season was structured.

### 5. **1991–2013: Argentine Primera División**
   - In **1991**, the league was rebranded as the **Argentine Primera División** (often simply referred to as the **Primera División**), emphasizing its national importance. This new structure reflected a more modern approach to Argentine football, with better organization and professionalization.
   - Throughout this period, the competition was governed by the Argentine Football Association (AFA), and the name **Argentine Primera División** remained consistent.
   - The league continued to be known as the **Primera División**, although sponsorship deals sometimes influenced its formal name (e.g., **Primera División Cablevisión**, **Primera División Quilmes**).

### 6. **2013–2017: Primera División (with sponsorship)**
   - In **2013**, the Argentine league underwent further rebranding when the government took control of the league's broadcasting rights under the **Fútbol para Todos** initiative. This period was marked by significant political involvement and economic restructuring.
   - The name **Primera División** continued to be used, but some seasons saw the inclusion of sponsor names, and the league sometimes operated under the informal name **Superliga Argentina**.

### 7. **2017–Present: Superliga Argentina**
   - In **2017**, the league was officially rebranded as the **Superliga Argentina** (also referred to as the **Superliga**), reflecting a shift towards more professional management and an effort to modernize Argentine football.
   - The **Superliga Argentina** was intended to resemble European football leagues by giving more commercial freedom and improving the organization of the competition.
   - While the **Superliga Argentina** had more autonomy, it was still governed by the AFA. The name **Superliga Argentina** continued until **2020**, when another structural change occurred.

### 8. **2020–Present: Liga Profesional de Fútbol**
   - In **2020**, the **Superliga Argentina** was replaced by the **Liga Profesional de Fútbol** (Professional Football League), marking the most recent rebranding. This change was made as part of the AFA’s ongoing efforts to further professionalize and commercialize the competition.
   - The **Liga Profesional de Fútbol** is currently the official name of Argentina's top football division, which is governed directly by the AFA.
