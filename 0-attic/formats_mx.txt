q: what is the naming history of the Mexican Liga MX / tier 1 league. please use seasons for name changes. 

a:  The naming history of **Liga MX**, Mexico's top-tier football league, has evolved over time, influenced by structural changes, rebranding efforts, and sponsorships. Below is the detailed breakdown of its naming history based on the seasons:

### 1. **1943–1996: Primera División (First Division)**
   - The **Primera División** (First Division) was the official name of Mexico's top football league from its formation in **1943** until **1996**.
   - This name was used for several decades and reflected the league's position as the highest level of football in Mexico.
   - Throughout this period, the league underwent several expansions and changes in structure, but the name **Primera División** remained constant.

### 2. **1996–2011: Primera División de México (with "Verano" and "Invierno" tournaments)**
   - In **1996**, Mexico's football league underwent a significant restructuring, and the league was rebranded as **Primera División de México** (First Division of Mexico). This was the official name after the league's shift to a two-tournament season format (Invierno for the winter season and Verano for the summer season).
   - The name remained **Primera División de México**, but the league began to be organized by two separate tournaments in a calendar year—one in the winter (Invierno) and one in the summer (Verano), starting in the 1996-97 season.

### 3. **2011–Present: Liga MX**
   - In **2011**, the Mexican First Division underwent another major rebranding. The league was renamed **Liga MX**, with the "MX" signifying "México." This rebranding reflected an attempt to modernize the league and boost its visibility both within and outside of Mexico.
   - The change to **Liga MX** was not only about the name but also about improving the league's infrastructure and professionalism. It was also an effort to give the league a more international appeal, distinguishing it from other national leagues around the world.
   - Since **2011**, the league has been known as **Liga MX**, and it has continued to operate under this name. Like in previous eras, the league has had sponsorship deals that may affect the official title during certain periods, such as **Liga Bancomer MX** or **Liga MX Claro** (based on the sponsors), but **Liga MX** is the core name.

### Summary of Name Changes:
- **1943–1996**: Primera División (First Division)
- **1996–2011**: Primera División de México
- **2011–Present**: Liga MX (with occasional sponsorships, e.g., **Liga Bancomer MX**)

The most significant name change occurred in **2011**, when the league adopted the name **Liga MX** to modernize and rebrand the competition. This has been the name of Mexico's top division since then, although sponsorships occasionally modify the full official name for marketing purposes.
