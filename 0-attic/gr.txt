please use seasons for name changes.

a: The naming history of Greece's top football division, currently known as the **Super League Greece**, has evolved over time, with different names reflecting changes in its structure, sponsorship, and overall management. Below is the detailed breakdown of the naming history of the Greek top-tier league:

### 1. **1927–1979: Panhellenic Championship**
   - From **1927**, the top-tier football league in Greece was known as the **Panhellenic Championship** (Πανελλήνιο Πρωτάθλημα). This competition was the predecessor to the modern-day Greek top league and was organized by the Hellenic Football Federation (HFF).
   - The name remained consistent for several decades, even though the structure of the competition evolved with the inclusion of more clubs.

### 2. **1979–2006: Alpha Ethniki**
   - In **1979**, the Greek top division was rebranded as the **Alpha Ethniki** (Α΄ Εθνική), which directly translates to "First National". This name was used until **2006**.
   - The league underwent significant changes during this period, including professionalization, expansion, and increased competition. The term "Alpha Ethniki" was widely recognized as the name of the premier football competition in Greece.

### 3. **2006–2007: Super League Greece (initial rebranding)**
   - In **2006**, the Greek top division underwent a major transformation. The **Super League Greece** (Σούπερ Λιγκ Ελλάδας) was established, replacing **Alpha Ethniki**. This change was primarily for branding and organizational purposes, reflecting a shift toward modernizing the league and improving its appeal.
   - The Super League Greece began its first season in **2006-07**, marking a fresh start for the top-tier league. The initial period of rebranding focused on streamlining the competition under the umbrella of the newly formed **Super League Greece** organization.

### 4. **2007–2010: Greek Superleague (with sponsorship)**
   - Following the formation of the Super League, the league was also referred to as the **Greek Superleague**, with sponsorship agreements influencing the full name of the competition during this period. For example, it became known as the **Greek Superleague (with various sponsors)** during this time, but the core name remained **Super League Greece**.

### 5. **2010–Present: Super League Greece (with sponsorship)**
   - Since **2010**, the league has retained the name **Super League Greece**, though sponsorship deals have influenced its official title.
   - For instance, the league has been called the **Super League Greece (with various sponsors)** in some seasons. Sponsorship names such as **Super League Greece (OPAP)** and **Super League Greece (stoiximan.gr)** have been used, reflecting the involvement of commercial partners.

### Summary of Name Changes:
- **1927–1979**: Panhellenic Championship
- **1979–2006**: Alpha Ethniki
- **2006–2007**: Super League Greece (first season)
- **2007–2010**: Greek Superleague (with sponsorship)
- **2010–Present**: Super League Greece (with sponsorship)

The key changes occurred in **1979**, when the league became **Alpha Ethniki**, and again in **2006**, when the competition was rebranded as the **Super League Greece**. The name has remained largely consistent since then, with occasional adjustments due to sponsorship.
