q:  what is the naming history of the scotch premiership / tier 1 league. 
please use seasons for name changes.

a:  The naming history of Scotland's top football division, currently known as the **Scottish Premiership**, has undergone several changes over the years, largely driven by reorganizations and sponsorships. Below is a detailed breakdown of its naming history based on the seasons:

### 1. **1890–1998: Scottish Football League First Division**
   - From its inception in **1890**, the top tier of Scottish football was known as the **Scottish Football League First Division**. This name continued for over a century as the league's primary designation. The Scottish Football League (SFL) itself was responsible for organizing football in Scotland.

### 2. **1998–2013: Scottish Premier League (SPL)**
   - In **1998**, a major restructure took place in Scottish football. The top tier of the Scottish Football League became the **Scottish Premier League** (SPL), separating from the Scottish Football League as a standalone competition.
   - This change was driven by the desire to make the top tier more commercially viable and to create a more competitive structure. The SPL operated as Scotland's top division from **1998 to 2013**.

### 3. **2013–Present: Scottish Premiership**
   - In **2013**, the Scottish Premier League merged with the Scottish Football League to form the **Scottish Professional Football League** (SPFL), which now governs all levels of Scottish football. 
   - The top division within the SPFL was named the **Scottish Premiership**. This marked the end of the SPL as an entity and the beginning of the new structure. The **Scottish Premiership** has continued under the governance of the SPFL, with the league title remaining in place.
   - As of the 2013-14 season, the top tier is called the **Scottish Premiership**, a name that has remained in use to this day.

### Summary of Name Changes:
- **1890–1998**: Scottish Football League First Division
- **1998–2013**: Scottish Premier League (SPL)
- **2013–Present**: Scottish Premiership (under the Scottish Professional Football League - SPFL)

The changes reflect a restructuring of the league, including a move towards greater commercial independence and later integration into a larger governance structure. The most recent change in 2013 established the **Scottish Premiership** as the name for the top division within the new SPFL system.
