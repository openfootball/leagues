q: what is the naming history of the Belgian tier 1 football league. 
please use seasons for name changes.

a:  The naming history of **Belgium's top-tier football league** has evolved over time, with changes reflecting structural shifts, sponsorship deals, and branding efforts. Below is the detailed breakdown of the naming history of Belgium's first-tier football league based on the seasons:

### 1. **1895–1995: Division I (First Division)**
   - The Belgian top football league was originally known as **Division I** or **First Division** (in French, "Division d'Honneur") when it was first established in **1895**. This name continued for the majority of the 20th century and reflected the league's position as the highest level of professional football in Belgium.
   - During this period, the league grew in terms of the number of participating teams and its overall structure, but the name **Division I** or **First Division** remained unchanged.

### 2. **1995–2008: Belgian First Division (with sponsorship)**
   - In **1995**, the league's official name was modified to **Belgian First Division** (in French, "Jupiler Pro League" and in Dutch, "Jupiler Pro League") due to a sponsorship agreement with the Belgian beer brand **Jupiler**. This sponsorship marked the beginning of commercial branding in Belgian football, with Jupiler being the prominent sponsor of the competition.
   - The league was referred to as the **Belgian First Division** during this period, but it was commonly marketed with the sponsor's name, **Jupiler Pro League**, particularly in advertising and media coverage.

### 3. **2008–2015: Jupiler Pro League**
   - Starting from **2008**, the league officially became known as the **Jupiler Pro League** due to an ongoing and more formal sponsorship deal with the beer brand **Jupiler**. The sponsorship further solidified the connection between the league and the Jupiler brand, and the league was widely referred to as the **Jupiler Pro League** during this time.
   - The name remained **Jupiler Pro League** for several years, representing the top level of Belgian football.

### 4. **2015–Present: Pro League (with sponsorship)**
   - In **2015**, the **Belgian Pro League** dropped the "Jupiler" sponsorship from its official name, becoming simply the **Pro League**. This marked a shift away from a specific beer sponsor in the official name, although the competition continued to be associated with sponsorship deals.
   - While the official name became **Pro League**, the league continued to be commercially known by different sponsorship names over the years. For example, in some seasons, it was known as **Jupiler Pro League** or **Pro League** depending on the sponsorship at the time, but the governing body itself officially called it the **Pro League**.

### Summary of Name Changes:
- **1895–1995**: Division I (First Division)
- **1995–2008**: Belgian First Division (with sponsorship, commonly **Jupiler Pro League**)
- **2008–2015**: Jupiler Pro League
- **2015–Present**: Pro League (with sponsorship, e.g., **Jupiler Pro League**)

The most significant name changes occurred in **1995**, with the introduction of sponsorship, and in **2008**, when the league formally adopted the **Jupiler Pro League** name. In **2015**, the league was rebranded as the **Pro League**, marking a shift toward a more neutral and flexible name, although sponsorships continued to influence the league's commercial identity.
